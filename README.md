The repository contains a simple React application designed to display products with a rating and price, allowing users to view product details.


Approach

1- Component-Based Structure: The project is organized into 2 Pages (Home, ProductDetails), reusable components (Product, RatingStars, LoadingScreen), and 1 Service.

2- Data Fetching: used Axios in one Service to maintain clean and manageable code.

3-Styling: Used Tailwind CSS to streamline the styling process, which was my best choice for speed and responsive layout.

4-Error Handling: Notify the user of any issues with data fetching using react-toastify.
